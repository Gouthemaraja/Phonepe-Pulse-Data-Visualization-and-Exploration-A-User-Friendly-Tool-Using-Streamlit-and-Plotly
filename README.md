## Problem Statement

The Phonepe Pulse Github repository contains an extensive dataset encompassing diverse metrics and statistics. The challenge is to extract, process, and analyze this data to derive insights that can be presented through an accessible and informative dashboard.

The solution involves the following steps:

1. **Data Extraction:** The data will be fetched from the Phonepe Pulse Github repository using scripting, and it will be cloned to the local environment.

2. **Data Transformation:** Utilizing Python, particularly the Pandas library, the data will undergo preprocessing and cleaning. This phase may involve handling missing values, reformatting data, and preparing it for analysis and visualization.

3. **Database Insertion:** The cleaned and transformed data will be inserted into a MySQL database using the "mysql-connector-python" library. This step ensures efficient data storage and retrieval.

4. **Dashboard Creation:** Leveraging the capabilities of Streamlit and Plotly in Python, an interactive dashboard will be developed. Plotly's geo mapping features will be utilized to display data on maps, while Streamlit will facilitate a user-friendly interface with dropdown options for users to select various data points.

5. **Data Retrieval:** The "mysql-connector-python" library will be employed again to fetch data from the MySQL database into a Pandas dataframe. This data will be used to dynamically update the dashboard.

6. **Deployment:** The solution will undergo rigorous testing to ensure security, efficiency, and user-friendliness. Once validated, the dashboard will be deployed publicly, making it readily accessible to users.

## Approach

1. **Data Extraction:** The Phonepe Pulse Github repository will be cloned using scripting to obtain the necessary data, which will be stored in formats like CSV or JSON.

2. **Data Transformation:** Python, along with Pandas, will be employed to manipulate and preprocess the data. This phase includes tasks such as data cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming data for analysis and visualization.

3. **Database Insertion:** The "mysql-connector-python" library will enable a connection to the MySQL database for data insertion through SQL commands.

4. **Dashboard Creation:** Using Streamlit and Plotly libraries, an engaging dashboard will be crafted. Plotly's geo map functionalities will visualize data geographically, while Streamlit will provide dropdown options for users to select specific data for display.

5. **Data Retrieval:** The "mysql-connector-python" library will again be used to fetch data from MySQL into a Pandas dataframe, enabling dynamic updates to the dashboard.

6. **Deployment:** Thorough testing will ensure security and efficiency. Following validation, the dashboard will be deployed for public access, delivering valuable insights from the Phonepe Pulse Github repository.

This approach harnesses Python's capabilities, along with various libraries, to extract, transform, and analyze data. The result is a user-friendly dashboard that enhances the understanding of the Phonepe Pulse Github repository's data.
