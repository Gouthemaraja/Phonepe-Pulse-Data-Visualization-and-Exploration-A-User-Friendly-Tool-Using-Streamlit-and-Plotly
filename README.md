Problem Statement
The Phonepe Pulse Github repository contains a substantial amount of data related to various metrics and statistics. The challenge is to extract, process, and analyze this data to derive insights that can be presented through an accessible and informative dashboard.

The solution involves the following steps:

Data Extraction: The data will be fetched from the Phonepe Pulse Github repository using scripting, and it will be cloned to the local environment.

Data Transformation: Utilizing Python, particularly the Pandas library, the data will undergo preprocessing and cleaning. This phase may involve handling missing values, reformatting data, and preparing it for analysis and visualization.

Database Insertion: The cleaned and transformed data will be inserted into a MySQL database using the "mysql-connector-python" library. This step ensures efficient data storage and retrieval.

Dashboard Creation: Leveraging the capabilities of Streamlit and Plotly in Python, an interactive dashboard will be developed. Plotly's graphing features will be used to display data visually, while Streamlit will facilitate a user-friendly interface with dropdown options for users to select various data points.

Data Retrieval: The "mysql-connector-python" library will be employed again to fetch data from the MySQL database into a Pandas dataframe. This data will be used to dynamically update the dashboard.

This approach leverages Python's capabilities, along with various libraries, to extract, transform, and analyze data. The result is a user-friendly dashboard that enhances the understanding of the Phonepe Pulse Github repository's data.
